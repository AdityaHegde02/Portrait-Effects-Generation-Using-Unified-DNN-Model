# Portrait-Effects-Generation-Using-Unified-DNN-Model

• Developed an Unified DNN Model that Generates High key and Low Key Images from Input RGB Image and
an Alpha Channel Guide that is based on the User Choice.
• Generated Segmentation Mask Of Input Image using MobilenetV2 Architecture and then Added High key Low
key Effects using Modified U-Net Architecture.
• Improved the Overall Model Performance and Accuracy by Iteratively Fine-Tuning Key Parameters, resulting
in Enhanced Image Effects and More Precise Segmentation.
